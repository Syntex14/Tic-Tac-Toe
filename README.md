# Tic-Tac-Toe

Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game using everything I learned from the Odin Project so far. 

I'll be attempting to use
    Modules
    Factory Functions
    DOM manipulation
    Closure
    Inheritance
    And much more!

It's with the expectation that I learn how to apply these concepts to create an efficent, running game.
